Description: Simple MTP fuse filesystem driver
 SIMPLE-MTPFS (Simple Media Transfer Protocol FileSystem) is a file system for
 Linux (and other operating systems with a FUSE implementation, such as Mac OS X
 or FreeBSD) capable of operating on files on MTP devices attached via
 USB to local machine. On the local computer where the SIMPLE-MTPFS is
 mounted, the implementation makes use of the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)
 kernel module. The practical effect of this is that the end user can seamlessly
 interact with MTP device files.
 .
 MTPfs is a FUSE filesystem that supports reading and writing from MTP (Media
 Transfer Protocol) devices, such as MP3 players, video players or digital
 cameras.
 .
 In addition to revealing media files on the connected device, MTPfs exposes a
 virtual directory called "/Playlists" which contains the device's playlists as
 m3u files.
