1. ABSTRACT
===========

SIMPLE-MTPFS (Simple Media Transfer Protocol FileSystem) is a file system for
Linux (and other operating systems with a FUSE implementation, such as Mac OS X
or FreeBSD) capable of operating on files on MTP devices attached via
USB to local machine. On the local computer where the SIMPLE-MTPFS is
mounted, the implementation makes use of the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)
kernel module. The practical effect of this is that the end user can seamlessly
interact with MTP device files.

2. LATEST VERSION
=================

3. MOUNTING
===========

To mount MTP-based device to your local filesystem, simply run:

simple-mtpfs <mountpoint>

To unmount MTP device, use following:

fusermount -u <mountpoint>

4. INSTALLING
=============

Simple-mtpfs depends on fuse (version >2.8) and libmtp. It also requires the C++
compiler to support c++11 standard.

To install the driver, follow these steps:

  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure
  make
  make install (as root)

If you got the sources from git repository, first you have to run:
  ./autogen.sh
